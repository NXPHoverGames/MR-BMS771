# MR-BMS771 | RDDRONE-BMS772
NuttX source code for BMS example application using the MR-BMS771 all-in-1 BMS board (7-14 cells) .
Can be used with the RDDRONE-BMS772 board (3-6 cells) as well.

Please download and read the release notes (version 7.0 or higher) to see all the needed information on the software and the board, like how to start it up.

## short description of the code
The C/C++ based RTOS BMS example code provides an example on how to use the MC33771C BCC IC with the S32K146 MCU for an all-in-one BMS solution.
As it is a MCU based solution. You can configure this BMS example to be tuned for the wanted cell type and configuration if the hardware supports this.
It can measure all cell voltages, BMS input and BMS output voltage, the current as well as coulomb counting for better SOC estimation and 1 (up to 3) external temperature sensors can be measured as well as 3 on-board temperature sensors.
This SW example provides basic configurable protections (OV, UV, OT, UT, OC) and will control the build in power switch to protect the battery.
It shows a simple way balancing the cells while charging. 
Furthermore this example will calculate and communicate all kind of parameters, like State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH).

For communication with this BMS board, a couple example have been programmed. 
CyphalCAN or DroneCAN protocol can be used to configure the BMS or provide the needed information.
UART can be used to configure the BMS via a console or retrieve the needed information.
SMBus can be used to get the information from the BMS.
There is an example on how to use the NTAG5 NFC IC to be able to tap the antenna with a phone to read out some data.

## Disclaimer - CAUTION WARNING
### CAUTION - WARNING
Lithium and other batteries are dangerous and must be treated with care. 
Rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries are potentially hazardous and can present a serious FIRE HAZARD if damaged, defective or improperly used. Larger Lithium batteries and those used for industrial use involving high discharge current and frequent full discharge cycles require special precautions.

Do not connect this BMS to a lithium ion battery without expertise and  training in handling and use of batteries of this type.
Use appropriate test equipment and safety protocols during development.

This readme files will explain how to get the right nuttx and nuttx-apps repository with the BMS7.0 patches and build the BMS software (create a binary file).
This will work best on a linux machine, you could use a virtual machine for it.

See this webpage for the NuttX quickstart guide: https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/10.0.0/quickstart/quickstart.html

### MBDT
Both BMS boards are supported in MBDT, for the MBDT bringup examples see:
* BMS771: https://community.nxp.com/t5/NXP-Model-Based-Design-Tools/MR-BMS771-Demo-Application/ta-p/1919177
* BMS772: https://community.nxp.com/t5/NXP-Model-Based-Design-Tools/Example-Model-RDDRONE-BMS772/ta-p/1550394 

There should be a full BMS example on nxp.com.

```
## Install the Kconfig tools and the crosscompiler if needed
When this is your first NuttX project, you need to install the Kconfig tools and the cross compiler. Otherwise you can skip this part and continue with "configure and make the binary".
### Install the Kconfig tools if needed
Install the build essentials and everything that is needed.
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install flex
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install bison
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install gperf
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```
Install the kconfig-frontends. If this doesn't work, see below 'Installing kconfig-frontends'
```bash
sudo apt-get install kconfig-frontends
```

### Install the cross compiler if needed
Tested with version 9.3.1.
If not already installed, install the cross compiler with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

## Configure and make the binary
Configure for the MR-BMS771 board.
For normal use:
```bash
tools/configure.sh -e mr-bms771:bms
```
For debug purposes BMS771:
```bash
tools/configure.sh -e mr-bms771:bmsdebug
```
Or configure for the RDDRONE-BMS772 board.
For normal use:
```bash
tools/configure.sh -e rddrone-bms772:bms
```
For debug purposes BMS772:
```bash
tools/configure.sh -e rddrone-bms772:bmsdebug
```

Make the binary with: 
```bash
make
```
## Using the command line interface (CLI) of the BMS
Make sure the BMS is powered and everything is connected properly to the BMS.

Use a UART terminal like minicom on a linux machine or PuTTY or teraTerm on a windows machine and connect to the right COM port.
The settings are:
*	115200 Baud
*	8 data bits
*	1 stop bit

## Programming the BMS with the JLink debugger
See the release notes of the BMS771 or the BMS772 how to attach the debugger.

To program the BMS using a JLink debugger you need to have JLink installed.
Make sure the BMS is powered.

Open a terminal where the nuttx.bin file is located (probably in the nuttx folder).
Open JLink:
```bash
JLinkExe
```
Connect to it:
```bash
connect
```
Enter the correct device (S32K146 for BMS771 and S32K144 for BMS772):
```bash
S32K146
```
Program it using SWD:
```bash
s
```
Use 1000kHz as target interface speed:
```bash
1000
```
Reset the device:
```bash
r
```
Reset the entire flash by sending these commands:
```bash
w1 0x40020007, 0x44     
```
```bash
w1 0x40020000, 0x80    
```
Load the nuttx binary at address 0
```bash
loadbin nuttx.bin 0
```
Reset the device
```bash
r
```
Run the program
```bash
g
```
Quit the JLinkExe 
```bash
q
```
## Installing kconfig-frontends
If the installation of kconfig-frontends did not work:
Go back from the nuttx directory and make a tools directory next to it.
From the nuttx directory:
```bash
cd ..
```
```bash
mkdir -p tools
```
```bash
cd tools
```
Clone the nuttx tools master.
```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/tools/src/master
```
```bash
cd master
```
Apply the patch.
```bash
patch -p1 < ../../apps/nxp_bms/BMS_v1/Patchfiles/0001-aclocal-fix.patch
```
Configure and install it.
```bash
cd kconfig-frontends
```
```bash
./configure --enable-mconf --disable-nconf --disable-gconf --disable-qconf
```
```bash
make
```
```bash
sudo make install
```
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```
